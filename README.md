# Surprising-Discoveries-for-Online-Health-Information
In this project, we developed a computational approach to identify “surprising” news from a news corpus related to diabetes. Usually a surprise might be general to society or personalized one. Through our approach we have discovered a personal surprise.

Tools Used: R

Techniques Used: Data pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Cluster Analysis, Topic Modeling & Correlation.

Data preprocessing was performed to create corpus vector and word frequencies were normalized to identify the more discriminative words in the collection.

Applied K-means clustering technique to get summary insights into overall content of the corpus.

Top 5 topics were extracted, and correlation was calculated to discover surprising news.
